### About

This repository contains materials used for my master thesis in the Winter Semester of 2023/2024. This master thesis was submitted to the department of economics at the
Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn on 05.04.2024. The topic of the thesis is "Financial Liberalization in Transition Economies: Implications for Income Inequality
in South Eastern Europe". This thesis explores the role of financial liberalization in eight South Eastern European countries and its impact on income inequality during the period
between the years 2000 and 2016. Furthermore, it provides short historical background on the region, explores the financial liberalization process and how the financial systems 
are structured within the countries, and contains empirical analysis that explore the relationship between financial liberalization and income inequality.

### Data

The data for the analysis is collected from several sources, including: World Bank (WB), World Income Inequality Database (WIID), Fraser Institute, International Monetary Fund (IMF), 
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Freedom House, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Database of Political Institutions (DPI).

The time period for which the data is collected is between the years 2000 and 2016. 

The data is obtained for the following countries:

- Albania
- North Macedonia
- Serbia
- Montenegro
- Bosnia and Herzegovina
- Croatia
- Slovenia
- Bulgaria
- Romania

All of the data files used to construct the data set can be found in the folder "Data". Furthermore, the final data set that was used for the empirical analysis can be found in the 
same folder, under the sub-folder final_data. In this sub-folder there are two files, named: final_data_see, and final_data_world. The first file (.._see) contains data for the countries
of South Eastern Europe. The second file (.._world) contains data for countries belonging different regions of the world. This file (.._world) was only used for constructing tables that
were used to compare more developed economies with the economies of the countries used in the main analysis. Both of the files can be found in csv and dta formats.
